# Audible Annotations

Audible annotations is a webapp that allows users to add audible annotations while making audio recordings.

These annotations always start with the word "annotating" so when the audio recording is transcribed,
they are easy to find by searching for "annotating" in the text.

This software was built to assist visually impaired users, but it can be used by everyone who finds it useful.

Press 7, 9, 1 and 3 make an audible annotation. Press 5 to make an "undo" annotation.
